              COVID-19 vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials and approved because the
              studies show that the vaccine reduces the likelihood of contracting the virus
              significantly. Based on previous research into vaccines for other diseases, the
              COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from becoming seriously ill even if you do
              contract the virus. Getting vaccinated may also protect those around you, especially
              those at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

          The illusory truth effect, also known as the illusion of truth,
          describes how, when we hear the same false information repeated
          again and again, we often come to believe it is true.
