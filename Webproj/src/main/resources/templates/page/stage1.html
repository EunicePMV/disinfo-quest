                    Disinformation, also known as "fake news," is a growing problem in today's society.
                    It refers to the deliberate spread of false or misleading information with the
                    intention of manipulating public opinion and causing confusion. The rise of the
                    internet and social media has made it easier than ever for disinformation to spread
                    quickly and reach a large audience. Disinformation can take many forms, from fabricated
                    news stories and conspiracy theories to manipulated images and videos. It can be spread
                    through various mediums such as social media, traditional news outlets, and even through
                    word of mouth. The consequences of disinformation can be severe, from undermining trust
                    in democratic institutions to inciting violence and spreading hate.
